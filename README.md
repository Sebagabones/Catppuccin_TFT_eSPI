# Catppuccin_TFT_eSPI
Catppuccin colours for the [TFT_eSPI library](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)

Colours have to be in 5:6:5 format, so they won't be exactly the same as the OG Catppuccin Colours, but I have found them close enough to be nice to use

## Usage
Simply include the flavour from `include`, and use the colour definitions set there.

If you want to use multiple flavours at the same time, use the colour definitions set in `include/AllFlavoursCatppuccin_TFT_eSPI.h`.
